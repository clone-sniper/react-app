A JavaScrpit/REACT practice project designed to somewhat imitate a online shopping cart. Used to practice on how to program a REACT app that invovles multiple components horizontally and vertically. Has the standard button to increase or decrease the count value of each element, a X button for each element to remove it from the list, a reset button to reset all values to zero, and a add button to create new element with a unique Integer ID. Also a simple navbar that tracks how many elements has a value of one or more.
